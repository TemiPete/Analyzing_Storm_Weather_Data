# Reproducible Research: Analyzing Storm Weather Data

This project was done to analyse some Weather Storm Data and the impact on population health and to the economy across the US between the years 1950 and 2011. Severe events can result in catastrophic damage to the public in terms of health impact (fatalities, injuries), and economic impact (property damage and crop destruction). The data is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). There is a documentation available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf) to explain the dataset indepth. This [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf) is also available.
